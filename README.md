## Description

This project is a 3D visualization of Earth created using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a powerful WebGL-based 3D engine. The scene features a realistic Earth model with detailed surface textures, city lights, clouds, and a glow effect that simulates atmospheric scattering. The project also includes a starfield background and interactive controls, allowing users to explore the Earth from various perspectives.

## Features

- **Realistic Earth Model:** 
  - High-resolution textures for Earth's surface, specular highlights, bump mapping for terrain, and night-time city lights.
- **Atmospheric Glow:** 
  - Utilizes a Fresnel effect to simulate the Earth's atmospheric glow, enhancing the realism of the scene.
- **Dynamic Cloud Layer:** 
  - Adds a transparent, rotating cloud layer above the Earth's surface, giving a more lifelike appearance.
- **Interactive Controls:** 
  - OrbitControls enable users to rotate, zoom, and pan around the Earth for an interactive experience.
- **Starfield Background:** 
  - A procedurally generated starfield surrounds the Earth, adding visual depth to the scene.
- **Responsive Design:** 
  - The visualization adapts to different screen sizes and aspect ratios, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhrypt/scaling-spoon.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd scaling-spoon
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the 3D Earth visualization.

## Usage
- Use your mouse to interact with the scene:
  - Rotate: Click and drag to rotate the Earth.
  - Zoom: Scroll to zoom in and out.
  - Pan: Right-click and drag to pan around the scene.

## Future Enhancements
This project can be expanded with additional features, such as:
- Animated weather patterns on the Earth's surface.
- Satellite data visualization (e.g., displaying satellite paths around the Earth).
- Visualization of other planetary bodies in the solar system.
